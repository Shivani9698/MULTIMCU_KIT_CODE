**OLED Display Control with Adafruit Libraries**

**Overview:**
This repository contains instructions and resources for controlling an OLED display using the Adafruit SSD1306 and Adafruit GFX libraries with Arduino IDE.

**Instructions:**

1. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   Ensure you have Arduino IDE installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Arduino website: [Arduino IDE Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Open Library Manager:**
   Open Arduino IDE and navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`. This will launch the Library Manager.

3. **Install SSD1306 Library:**
   In the Library Manager search bar, type `SSD1306` and press Enter. Locate the SSD1306 library from Adafruit and click on the `Install` button to install it.

4. **Install GFX Library:**
   After installing the SSD1306 library, repeat the process for the GFX library. In the Library Manager search bar, type `GFX` and press Enter. Locate the Adafruit GFX library and click on the `Install` button to install it.

5. **Restart Arduino IDE:**
   Once both libraries are installed, restart the Arduino IDE to ensure the changes take effect.

**Usage:**

1. **Include Libraries:**
   In your Arduino sketch, include the necessary libraries at the beginning of your code:
   ```cpp
   #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
   #include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
   ```

2. **Initialize Display:**
   Initialize the OLED display in your setup function, specifying the display dimensions and I2C address:
   ```cpp
   #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128
   #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64
   #define OLED_RESET -1  // Reset pin # (or -1 if sharing Arduino reset pin)
   Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);
   ```

3. **Display Content:**
   Utilize the functions provided by the libraries to display text, shapes, and graphics on the OLED display.

4. **Compile and Upload:**
   Compile your sketch and upload it to your Arduino board to see the output on the OLED display.
